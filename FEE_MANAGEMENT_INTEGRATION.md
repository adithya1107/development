```

## Mock Data Integration

For development and demonstration purposes, the system includes mock data setup:

### Quick Demo Access
The login page now includes development tools:
- **Demo Student Login**: Access student interface with sample data
- **Demo Admin Login**: Access admin interface with management capabilities  
- **Demo Parent Login**: Access parent interface for fee management
- **Clear Demo Data**: Reset the demo environment

### Mock Data Features
- Sample fee structures (tuition, hostel, library, examination fees)
- Mock payment history with various payment methods
- Realistic payment status scenarios (paid, pending, overdue)
- Comprehensive test data for all user interfaces

## Implementation Details

### 1. Student-Fee Mapping
```typescript
// Automatic assignment when student is created
CREATE TRIGGER assign_fees_to_new_student
  AFTER INSERT ON user_profiles
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION assign_default_fees_to_student();
```

### 2. Payment Processing
```typescript
// Process payment with full transaction tracking
const result = await feeManagementService.processPayment({
  userId: studentId,
  collegeId: collegeId,
  feeStructureId: selectedFee.fee_structure_id,
  amountPaid: amount,
  paymentMethod: paymentMethod,
  transactionId: `TXN${Date.now()}`,
  notes: `Payment for ${selectedFee.fee_type}`
});
```

### 3. Real-time Balance Calculation
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION calculate_student_balance(
  student_id_param UUID, 
  fee_structure_id_param UUID
)
RETURNS DECIMAL AS $$
-- Calculates current balance considering custom amounts and payments
$$;
```

### 4. Data Consistency Checks
- **Payment Validation**: Ensures payment amount doesn't exceed balance due
- **Fee Assignment Validation**: Prevents duplicate fee assignments
- **Status Synchronization**: Automatic status updates based on payments
- **Audit Logging**: Complete tracking of all fee-related operations

## User Interface Features

## Testing and Development

### Mock Data Setup
```typescript
// Set up mock student data
const mockStudent = setupMockData();

// Access student interface with sample fees
navigate('/student');
```

### Database Testing
```sql
-- Test fee assignment
SELECT * FROM get_student_fee_details('student_id');

-- Test payment processing  
SELECT * FROM student_payment_summary WHERE student_id = 'test_id';

-- Test reminder generation
SELECT generate_fee_reminders();
```
