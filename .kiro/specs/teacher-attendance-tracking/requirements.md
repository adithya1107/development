## Introduction

The Teacher Attendance Tracking feature enables teachers to efficiently mark student attendance using an interactive interface with text-to-speech functionality and keyboard shortcuts. The system will provide real-time attendance percentage calculations, integrate with the existing Supabase backend, and maintain consistency with the current UI/UX design patterns. This feature will streamline the attendance process while providing comprehensive tracking and reporting capabilities.
